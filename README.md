# Project-AI 
## Traditional Game "Macanan"

### Rules of the Game
After players decide to become either macanan or uwong (AI will take on the other role), they play according to the following rules:

- The first turn begins with the _uwong_. Out of the 21 pieces owned by _uwong_, only 9 pieces are used in this turn. These pieces can be placed anywhere on the board, but they must form a square. The remaining 12 pieces are kept in the player’s hand to be used in subsequent turns.

- Next, it’s _macanan_'s turn to place their piece on an empty spot on the board.

- The game alternates turns between _uwong_ and _macan_.

- On each turn, the _uwong_ player can:
    1. Place __one piece per turn__ from the remaining pieces in their hand onto an empty spot on the board.
    2. Once all pieces from their hand have been placed, the _uwong_ player can move an existing piece __one step per turn__ to an empty spot.

- The _macan_ player can choose __one of two actions__ to perform on their turn:
    1. Move the _macan_ piece to an empty spot within one step.
    2. Capture an _uwong_ piece by jumping over it. _Uwong_ pieces can be captured if they are aligned in a straight line (vertical, horizontal, or diagonal) and are in odd numbers (e.g., 1, 3, 5, etc.). Captured _uwong_ pieces are removed from the board and become the property of the _macan_ player.

### Objectives
- The _macan_ aims to capture as many _uwong_ pieces as possible.
- The _uwong_ strives to avoid being captured and to create a formation that traps the _macan_.

### Endgame Conditions
- The _macan_ wins if the _uwong_ cannot trap it. If the _uwong_ has fewer than 14 pieces remaining, it becomes very difficult to trap the _macan_, and the _uwong_ player loses.
- The _uwong_ wins if they successfully trap the _macan_ piece so it cannot move in any direction. If the _macan_ piece cannot move, the _macan_ player loses.
